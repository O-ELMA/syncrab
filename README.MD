## **Pre-Requisites** üîß

1. **Rust**: Install `rustup` to compile and run. [(more on Rust)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **SQLite**: Install `sqlite` to store backup jobs & logs. [(more on SQLite)](https://sqlite.org/).

   For arch-based systems, you can use `yay`:
   ```bash 
   yay -S rustup sqlite --noconfirm && rustup default stable
   ```

   or `paru`:
   ```bash 
   paru -S rustup sqlite --noconfirm && rustup default stable
   ```

## **How to Use** üöÄ

1. **Install**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/O-ELMA/syncrab.git && cd syncrab && bash ./install
   ```

2. **Run the TUI**:

   ```bash
   syncrab
   ```

3. **Run the backup job manually** (whenever you want):

   * `syncrab_b` can be run **without any arguments** or with `all`, `realtime`, `daily`, or `weekly` as an argument:

     ```bash
     syncrab_b            # sync active daily & weekly jobs that match the the current hour and day's criteria
     syncrab_b all        # sync all jobs (both active and inactive)
     syncrab_b realtime   # sync all active real-time jobs
     syncrab_b daily      # sync all active daily jobs
     syncrab_b weekly     # sync all active weekly jobs
     ```

4. **Uninstall**:

   Run the uninstall script:

   ```bash
   bash ./uninstall
   ```

## **Inputs** üìù

### **Source**

* **Type**: Text
* **Description**: The path of the file or folder that you want to copy somewhere else.

### **Target**

* **Type**: Text
* **Description**: The path of the destination folder where the source file/folder will be copied to.

### **Hour**

* **Type**: 2 digits (00-23)
* **Description**: The hour (24-hour format) when the job should run. This can be any number from 00 to 23.

### **Day**

* **Type**: 3 characters (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun)
* **Description**: Specifies the day when the job should run. Use the three-letter abbreviation for the day (e.g., Mon for Monday, Tue for Tuesday...).


### **Usage Example:**

Let‚Äôs say you enter the following paths:

* **üìÇ Source:** `/home/my files/My Pictures` 
* **üìÇ Target:** `/my hard drive/PC/Stored Pictures`

When the backup runs, the entire `My Pictures` folder (along with all its files and subfolders) from the **Source** folder will be copied to the **Target** location. Specifically, the contents of the `My Pictures` folder will be placed inside the `Stored Pictures` folder located within `/my hard drive/PC`.

If the target directories, namely `my hard drive` or `PC`, don‚Äôt already exist, they will be automatically created during the process.
